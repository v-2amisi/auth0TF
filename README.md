# Okta Configuration Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Okta for various authentication and authorization scenarios. It covers the following configurations:

- SAML IdP Setup for application authentication

- SAML SP Setup for supporting federated logins to applications

- Authorization Server Setup for issuing tokens to users

- OIDC Web Application Setup for reverse proxy authentication

- API Authorization Server for issuing user-based tokens

- OIDC M2M Application Setup for token requests on behalf of users

- Separate API Authorization Server for issuing tokens with custom scopes for internal M2M use cases

### SAML IdP Setup for Application Authentication

This setup allows an external application to authenticate users using Okta as a SAML Identity Provider (IdP).

Steps:

Navigate to Okta Admin Console → Security → Identity Providers

Click Add Identity Provider → SAML 2.0

Configure SAML IdP settings:

Issuer: Okta Org URL (e.g., https://org.okta.com)

Single Sign-On (SSO) URL: https://org.okta.com/app/.../sso/saml

Audience URI (SP Entity ID): Provided by the Service Provider (SP)

Name ID Format: EmailAddress or Persistent

Attribute Mapping: Map Okta user attributes to SAML attributes (e.g., email → NameID)

Save and Activate the IdP configuration

Share Metadata URL or XML with the Service Provider for integration

### SAML SP Setup for Supporting Federated Logins

This setup allows Okta to act as a SAML Service Provider (SP) to accept authentication from external Identity Providers (IdPs).

Steps:

Navigate to Okta Admin Console → Applications

Click Create App Integration → SAML 2.0

General Settings:

App Name: Enter the name of the federated application

App Visibility: Choose visibility settings

Configure SAML Settings:

Single Sign-On URL: Provided by the external IdP

Audience URI (SP Entity ID): Okta’s entity ID (e.g., https://org.okta.com)

Name ID Format: Matches IdP settings (EmailAddress, Persistent)

Attribute Statements: Map SAML attributes to Okta user profile fields

Assign Users/Groups: Define who can access this application

Save and Download Metadata: Provide this metadata to the external IdP for integration

### Authorization Server Setup for Issuing User Tokens

Okta provides a customizable Authorization Server to issue OAuth 2.0 and OIDC tokens.

Steps:

Navigate to Okta Admin Console → Security → API

Click Authorization Servers → Add Authorization Server

Define Authorization Server settings:

Name: Primary Auth Server

Audience: https://your-api.yourcompany.com

Create Scopes:

Example: read:data, write:data

Create Claims: Define JWT claims for the token

Create Policies & Rules:

Define who can request tokens and under what conditions

Save and Activate

### OIDC Web Application Setup for Reverse Proxy Authentication

This setup enables Okta to authenticate requests before they are routed to internal applications.

Steps:

Navigate to Okta Admin Console → Applications

Click Create App Integration → OIDC - Web Application

Define App Settings:

Sign-in Redirect URIs: https://reverse-proxy.org.com/callback

Sign-out Redirect URIs: https://reverse-proxy.org.com/logout

Assign users or groups who can access

Save and Note Client ID & Secret

Configure Reverse Proxy:

Implement authentication flow using Okta’s OIDC endpoints

### API Authorization Server for Issuing User-Based Tokens

This API Authorization Server is used to generate user-based tokens for APIs.

Steps:

Navigate to Okta Admin Console → Security → API

Click Authorization Servers → Create Authorization Server

Set Configuration:

Audience: https://user-api.org.com

Scopes: read:user, manage:account

Define Claims & Policies:

Map user attributes (e.g., sub, email)

Create rules for access control

Save & Test using Postman or another API tool

### OIDC M2M Application Setup for Reverse Proxy Token Requests

This setup enables a reverse proxy to request access tokens on behalf of users after authentication.

Steps:

Navigate to Okta Admin Console → Applications

Click Create App Integration → OIDC - Service

Define Application Settings:

Client Authentication: Client Secret - Basic

Grant Type: Client Credentials

Create API Scopes & Policies to restrict access

Save and Note Client ID & Secret

Implement Reverse Proxy Logic:

Proxy requests authentication

Uses token for backend API calls

### Separate API Authorization Server with Custom Scopes for M2M Use Cases

This setup involves creating a dedicated authorization server for internal machine-to-machine authentication with custom scopes.

Steps:

Navigate to Okta Admin Console → Security → API

Click Authorization Servers → Add Authorization Server

Define Server Settings:

Name: M2M Internal API Server

Audience: https://internal-api.org.com

Create Custom Scopes:

read:internal_data

write:internal_data

Configure Claims & Policies:

Restrict access to internal clients only

Define expiration policies

Save & Configure M2M Clients

Issue Client Credentials and test with internal services

Conclusion

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for configuring Okta for various authentication and authorization use cases. Ensure that all configurations align with security best practices and compliance requirements for your organization.
